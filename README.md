# SnippyAI-OCR-Chrome-Extension

Description:
- Image-to-Text software solution that emulates the functionality of a snipping tool, while harnessing the power of the GPT-4V API to seamlessly identify words within the captured image.

Features:
- Effortless Image Conversion: Enables users to convert text content from images with a simple click, streamlining data extraction.
- GPT-4V Integration: Seamlessly integrates with the powerful GPT-4V API for accurate and efficient text recognition within the snipped images.
- Productivity Booster: Enhances productivity by eliminating the need for manual transcription of text from images.
- One Click Conveniency: being a Chrome extension allows it to be lightweight and in a convenient spot for any online text-extracting needs.

Why?: 
- I wanted to copy notes from lecture slides and YouTube videos but found that other OCRs lack in speed, accuracy, and ease of access. I also wanted to try technology I've never used before and the idea of a Chrome extension sounds both challenging and fun.
